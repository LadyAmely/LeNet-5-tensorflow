# About This Repository

This repository contains an implementation of the **LeNet-5** model, originally introduced in the 1998 paper [*Gradient-Based Learning Applied to Document Recognition*](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-98.pdf) by **Yann LeCun**, **LÃ©on Bottou**, **Yoshua Bengio**, and **Patrick Haffner**.

LeNet-5 is one of the earliest convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, designed for handwritten digit recognition tasks. 

### Features:
- **Implementation**: Faithful reproduction of the original LeNet-5 architecture as described in the paper.
- **Pre-Trained Model**: Includes a pre-trained LeNet-5 model on the **MNIST dataset**.
- **High Performance**: Demonstrates high accuracy in recognizing handwritten digits.

### Dataset:
The model has been trained on the **MNIST dataset**, a widely used benchmark for evaluating machine learning algorithms in digit classification.
